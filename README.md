CS 330 – Computational Graphics and Visualization Portfolio Reflection

Working on this project helped me develop a stronger approach to designing software by thinking visually and structurally at the same time. I learned how to plan a 3D scene by considering object placement, scale, textures, and lighting before writing large amounts of code. My design process focused on breaking the scene into smaller components, building each object individually, and then refining how they worked together as a complete environment. This approach is something I can apply to future projects by planning ahead, testing early, and making intentional design decisions.

While developing the program, I used new strategies specific to graphics programming, such as managing transformations, applying textures, and adjusting lighting and materials. Iteration played a major role, as I frequently tested and adjusted object positions, scales, and lighting values to improve realism. Over the course of the milestones, my development approach became more organized and confident. I moved from simply getting objects to render correctly to refining details and producing a polished final scene.

This project showed me how computer science can support my long-term goals by expanding my technical skill set beyond traditional application development. Working with computational graphics and visualization gave me hands-on experience with rendering, camera control, and real-time visual feedback. These skills are useful in future coursework and can also be applied professionally, as they demonstrate my ability to work with complex systems, iterate on designs, and deliver a well-structured final product.
